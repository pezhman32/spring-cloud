# spring-cloud
Multi-Tier spring cloud project containing server and client modules connected by AMQP

NOTE: This project requires rabbitmq running on localhost. 
RabbitMQ installation page: https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html


In this sample project we've connected clients to server to read configs from server. Also clients can publish/listen to native spring events using AMPQ.
